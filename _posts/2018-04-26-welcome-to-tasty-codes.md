I always felt like I should blog, but in reality I never had the discipline to do it properly. I had an attempt with [my previous blog][last-blog], but after 19 posts over 4 years ('08-'12) you can tell it wasn't working. So why do it now? Well first of all I think I can handle it, that I have that discipline I was lacking a few years ago (or not, we'll see).

But there is also a more important reason behind it, I feel that I needed to blog: we live in a fast-paced world and things are getting more complex. As developers, to fully take advantage of technology you have to at least dip your toes in artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud, mobile, etc. I know what you are thinking, that *is* a stretch, but I think you get my point. Of course you can always maintain a legacy system in VB6, but what's the fun on that? So given this tremendous amount of information, sometimes it's good for me to just stop, write a little bit about what I'm learning. So this is part of **my process** to understand better a topic and filter all the noise around it.

So what are you going to find in this blog? the short answer is a glimpse at my life, mostly from the tech side but also from my personal side as well. I want it to be a social thing, share my findings but also share my adventures. Discuss my thoughts with friends and why not, with you, stranger, as well.

The format of the posts is yet to be decided but I will try to find some coherence as I go along.

One last thing to mention is that this blog is also an excuse to try to open source some of my code or at least some code examples, as such I will try to make it valuable for the community so if you think there is value from me to post on a particular topic please let me know on the comments or by email.
